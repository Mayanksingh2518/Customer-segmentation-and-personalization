- **StockCode:** Product (item) code.
- **Description:** Product (item) name.
- **Quantity:** The quantities of each product (item) per invoice.
- **InvoiceDate:** Invoice date and time.
- **UnitPrice:** Unit price of each product (item).
- **CustomerID:** Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Country:** Country of the customer.
